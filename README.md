# Road Accident Analysis and Insights Dashboard

# Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to systematically analyze extensive road accident datasets, cleanse and preprocess the data for accuracy and consistency, and develop a dynamic Excel dashboard that effectively visualizes the core insights. This tool aims to support policymakers, traffic safety authorities, and urban planners in understanding accident patterns and implementing data-driven safety interventions.

# Data Sources and Preparation
- Collected and consolidated multiple heterogeneous datasets related to road accidents spanning several years (2021-2023).
- Executed rigorous data cleaning protocols including identification and correction of missing or inconsistent records, removal of outliers, normalization of categorical data fields, and unification of temporal and geographic identifiers to ensure data integrity.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted detailed statistical and trend analyses focusing on casualty severity groups (fatal, serious, slight) and their distributions over time, by location, road type, and environmental conditions.
- Analyzed vehicle involvement by type and accident circumstances to reveal high-risk vehicle categories and accident scenarios.
- Examined temporal trends via month-wise comparisons across multiple years to identify seasonal or emerging patterns.
- Assessed impact factors such as lighting conditions (daylight vs. darkness) and road surface types (dry, wet, frost) to understand environmental influences on accident severity.

# Dashboard Features and Functionality
- Provides an at-a-glance summary of total casualties categorized by severity, vehicle type, and casualty circumstances, facilitating quick stakeholder comprehension.
- Interactive visual elements include line charts for trend analysis, bar charts for categorical comparisons, and doughnut charts for proportional insights.
- Slicers and filters enable customized data views by accident date and type of area (urban vs. rural), enhancing the dashboard’s utility for diverse analytical needs.
- Emphasizes critical insights such as the predominance of casualties on single carriageways and during dry conditions, guiding targeted safety measures.

# Impact and Applications
- Empowers traffic safety agencies and urban developers with precise, data-backed evidence to prioritize resource allocation and safety campaigns.
- Enables early detection of shifting accident patterns and timely adaptation of regulatory frameworks.
- Facilitates ongoing monitoring of road safety initiatives’ effectiveness through update-capable dashboard infrastructure.

# Technical Summary
- **Tools**: Excel for data cleaning, transformation, and dashboard design; integrated use of pivot tables, charts, and slicers for interactive visualization.
- **Data Volume**: Over 250,000 recorded casualties analyzed and visualized.
